# KBA-Medical-System
In this project, we designed and implemented a Knowledge-Based System (KBS) in Prolog to automate medical triage for basic consultations. The system is capable of diagnosing various medical conditions based on patient symptoms and suggesting appropriate treatments, using logic-based reasoning and rule-based decision-making.
